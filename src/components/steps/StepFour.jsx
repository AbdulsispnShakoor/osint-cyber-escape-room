We have a number of photos we need to look at and start to locate where these are from and what they mean. Look at each photo with as much detail as possible, look at anything that will help you start to pinpoint exact locations of where they are taken. Discuss this with your colleagues and start thinking about different tool for image reverse search. You have a lot of options from Bing, google and Yandex or any other search engine. <br />
Just message me with the three countries and I Will speak to the local authorities to further investigate.</p>
